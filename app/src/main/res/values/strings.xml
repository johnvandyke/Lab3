*************************************
* strings.xml stores all of the information for strings that are used through out the application.
* The reason why strings are created, are so widgets and variables can use text or images and
* they only have to be changed once.  An important string is @string/imgAlbum.  This is where the
* large image that a user selects in OtherAlbumsActivity.  The image that the user selects is passed
* to this string and then is displayed in an ImageView in the layout file.
